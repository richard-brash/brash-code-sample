# Brash Code Challenge API
> This is my response to the Code Challenge issued by Ventera - Next Steps.

The choices made while building this project were made in an effort to highlight 
some techniques that would make this project easier to expand and maintain
if it were part of a larger, more complex product. Admittedly, the solution is 
decidedly more involved than necessry but since this is part of the interview process, 
I decided to err on the side of more is indeed more.

## Installation

```sh
npm install (to install the artifacts)
touch .env (to create a dotEnv file for configuration)
edit .env   

    # Set to production when deploying to production
    NODE_ENV=development

    # Node.js server configuration
    SERVER_PORT=3000
```



## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
